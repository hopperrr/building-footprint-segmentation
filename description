Digitizing building footprints from the satellite images and creating the layers to prepare the base maps is very time-consuming task for the organizations. it includes lot of cost in terms of money and manpower.

Using deep learning models extracting building footprints is achievable. These models are very capable of learning these complex semantics and can produce good results with good accuracy and precision. This can also be useful in different areas like taxation, insurance, change detection and infra structure planning.
